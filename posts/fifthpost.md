## What is React Native

React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework. It's designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and web applications. It is based on React, and brings everything to mobile app development.

Both ReactJS (web) and React Native were brought on by Facebook. Facebook created it as a Hackathon project aiming to solve the company's two code bases for their app. React Native is a straight forward answer so that you don't have to run two different things instead you can create in one place.
