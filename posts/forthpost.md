When you work with APIs you can come up with some neat and creative ideas for your website.

### Benefits

The benefits of REST API:

1. REST APIs provide developers with the ability to organize complicated applications into simple resources.

2. REST APIs are deemed very easy to learn and understand.

3. They are also considerably  easier to scale than their alternatives.

4. It's easy for external clients to build their REST APIs without any hitches.

5. REST API isn't platform or language-specific, but can be consumed with any language or can easily be ran on any platform as well.

### CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete commands. These four major functions guide software developers to interact with databases.

- <b>Create</b> is a procedure that generates new records.
- <b>Read</b> is a procedure used to read/retrieve data based on desire input parameters.
-<b>Update</b> is used to modify records without overwriting.
- <b>Delete</b> is used to remove one or more entries entirely.

### Key Features of React

React allows for one-way data binding or unidirectional data flow. One-way data binding gives you more control of your application.

Each component in a ReactJS application has its own logic and controls. The components may be reused, which mkaes it easier to keep track of code while you're working on larger projects.

React is simple to understand as it mixes HTML and JavaScript ideas with some useful enhancements.

React uses Virtual DOM to accelerate development of web pages. Instead of updating all the components over and over again, ad traditional web applications do, Virtual DOM analyses the components' prior states and updates just the things in the Real DOM that have been changed. 

React makes use of JSX file, which makes the application easy to develop and understand.
