&emsp;Facebook created React.js in 2011 for their use. We know that Facebook is one of the biggest Social Networking websites in the world.
<br />
&emsp;In 2012, Instagram started using it as well, which is a subsidiary of Facebook.
<br />
&emsp;In 2013, Facebook made React.js an open-source. The developer community rejected it at first because it used Markup and JavaScript in a single file. But the more people who experimented with it started embracing the component.
<br />
&emsp;In 2014, there were many large companies starting to use React.js in their production environments.
<br />
&emsp;In 2015, Facebook decided to open-source React-Native. It is a library that allows us to create native mobile apps in Android and iOS using React.js.
<br />
&emsp;In 2016, version 15 was released. React.js started using Semantic Versioning. This really helped to convey to the developer's community that React was more stable.
<br />
&emsp;Today, React.js is used by many Fortune 500 companies. Facebook currently has a full-time React development staff. The staff regularly releases bug fixes, enhancements, blog posts, and documentation to the community.
