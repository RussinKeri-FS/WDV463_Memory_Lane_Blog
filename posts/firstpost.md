## Brief History of React.js

Facebook created React.js in 2011 for their use. We know that Facebook is one of the biggest Social Networking websites in the world.

In 2012, Instagram started using it as well, which is a subsidiary of Facebook.

In 2013, Facebook made React.js an open-source. The developer community rejected it at first because it used Markup and JavaScript in a single file. But the more people who experimented with it started embracing the component.

In 2014, there were many large companies starting to use React.js in their production environments.

In 2015, Facebook decided to open-source React-Native. It is a library that allows us to create native mobile apps in Android and iOS using React.js.

In 2016, version 15 was released. React.js started using Semantic Versioning. This really helped to convey to the developer's community that React was more stable.

Today, React.js is used by many Fortune 500 companies. Facebook currently has a full-time React development staff. The staff regularly releases bug fixes, enhancements, blog posts, and documentation to the community.

## Why Should You Use React?
